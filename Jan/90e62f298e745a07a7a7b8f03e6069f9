Former Information, Minister Labaran Maku, on Sunday called for the removal of immunity clause for elected executive officers from the country’s constitution. Maku, a gubernatorial candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Nasarawa State in 2015, made this call while fielding questions from newsmen in Wakama, Akun Development Area of the state.
He explained that the removal of the immunity clause would help tackle corruption and ensure good governance.
He specifically advocated the removal of the clause that protects the president, governors and their deputies from facing prosecution in breach of office.
He said that the immunity clause had created an umbrella for some state governors to tamper with their state resources, thereby leading to underdevelopment at the grassroots.
The former minister also advised Nigerians to pray for better things in the New Year as well as pray for permanent peace to reign in the country.
“Let us also pray for the peace of the country and give President Muhammadu Buhari the needed support and cooperation to enable him tackle the challenges facing the country.
“I believe that the immunity of state governors should be removed, no governor needs immunity and if it is removed, this will help to check fraud, corruption and mismanagement,’’ he said. (NAN)
