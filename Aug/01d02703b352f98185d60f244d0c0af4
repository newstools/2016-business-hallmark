A youth advocacy group under the aegis of Centre for Youth Participation Dialogue and Advocacy (CYPA Africa) has blamed the incessant cases of armed robbery, kidnapping and militancy being witnessed across the country on government’s inability/unwillingness to tackle most of the challenges facing the youths. CYPA Africa’s Executive Director, Comrade Chris Iyama, disclosed this in Jos, in commemoration of the 2016 United Nation’s International Youth Day, with the theme; ‘The Road to 2030: Eradicating Poverty, Achieving Sustainable Consumption and Production and the Leadership Role Young People can Play.’ “The rise in armed robbery, kidnapping, militancy are all products of government’s inability or willingness to tackle most of the problems facing Nigerian youths. “The present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, has made a lot of promises in areas of welfare which includes unemployment allowances, feeding of school pupils and other welfare programmes. “Nigerian youths are still waiting and counting on Government to fulfill its campaign promises. “We support the #Not Too Young To Run bill. This bill with gazette number HB 544 seeks to alter sections 65, 106, 131, 177 of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria (as amended) to reduce the age qualification for the office of the President from 40 years to 30 years; governor 35 to 30, Senate 35 to 30, House of Assembly 30 to 25. We use this medium to urge all Nigerians to support this movement,” he maintained that.  The group appealed to government at all levels to make youth participation in governance a policy. “In line with this year’s theme, government should eradicate poverty while achieving sustainable consumption and production,” the group stressed.
