Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Abubakar Sadiq, said on Thursday that establishment of Air Force formation in Bauchi would help in tackling criminal activities in the North-East. Sadiq stated this in Bauchi when he visited the Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rulwanu Suleiman Adamu, in his palace. He said that the construction of an Air Force Base in the city had commenced and that basic structures for it would be in place within three months. He said that building of the base would be carried out in two phases. According to him, the first phase will be completed before the end of January, 2017 when the second phase will commence. “I want to assure the host communities that hospital and a school will be established to enable you and your children benefit from such facilities,” Sadiq said. He commended the emir for the role he played in providing the 600 hectares of land for the base. He told the emir that apart from military installations, other facilities such as hospital and school would be constructed by the force to enable host communities benefit from its presence in the state. Sadiq reassured that the presence of the force would enhance security in the state and its neighbours. Responding, the emir commended Air Force authorities for establishing a base in the state. Adamu said that insecurity had shattered peace and economic development in the northern part of the country, particularly the North-East. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for providing succour to the region within his short time in office. He assured that his emirate would support the efforts being made by the authorities to establish air force formation in the state. (NAN)
