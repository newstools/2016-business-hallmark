The Federal Government says the clean-up of Ogoniland impacted by oil spill would commence in the first quarter of 2016. Dr Peter Idabor, the Director General of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), stated this on Thursday in Abuja in an interview. Idabor said that the clean-up would be undertaken by the Federal Ministry of Environment, adding that the ministry was currently meeting with all relevant stakeholders. It would be recalled that in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari directed actions to fast track the implementation of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) report on environmental restoration of Ogoniland. The actions were approved by the president based on recommendations made to him by the Executive Director of UNEP, Achim Steiner and other stakeholders. (NAN)
