The Supreme Court has upheld the election of Nyesom Wike of the Peoples Democratic Party as governor of Rivers State. The court gave the ruling validating the April 11 governorship election on Wednesday but did not provide reasons for its judgment.
It said detailed reasons for the verdict would be provided on February 12.
The Court of Appeal had on December 16  affirmed the judgment of the Rivers Governorship Election Tribunal.
The appeal court had  ruled that Wike was not validly elected.
The Rivers tribunal had earlier on October 24 nullified Wike’s election.
The tribunal, which delivered its ruling in Abuja, also ordered that a fresh governorship election be conducted in the state.
After the tribunal’s ruling, the governor headed to the Court of Appeal, saying the judgment was untenable.
The petition challenging the election of Wike as Rivers State governor was filed by Dakuku Peterside, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the election.
The Rivers governorship election, which was criticised by local and international observers, witnessed the largest amount of violence both in its build-up and after the election.
