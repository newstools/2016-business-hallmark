 Founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, is currently in a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. The meeting is holding at the Presidentâ€™s Office at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The technology entrepreneur had arrived Lagos unannounced on Tuesday for his first visit to the sub-Saharan Africa. He had landed in Nairobi on Thursday, but apparently returned to Nigeria following criticisms that he did not meet with any political leader during his stay in Nigeria, but only had interactions with software developers, bloggers and entertainers.
