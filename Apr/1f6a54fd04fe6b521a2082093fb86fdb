 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari at Fridayâ€™s emergency meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC). Buhari was clearly absent as the meeting which began around 11 am at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, with Osinbajo presiding. The meeting was verbally called to order by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Babachir Lawal, while the Vice President called for opening prayers. This was the point that newshounds were excused from the meeting as it is still unclear whether President Buhari would join the meeting later or not.
