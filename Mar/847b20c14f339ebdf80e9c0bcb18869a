 UNIDO to help SMEs in Nigeria meet international market standards The Head of United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Investment and Technology Promotion Office (ITPO) in Nigeria, Mrs Adebisi Olumodimu, has said that the office will focus more on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Olumodimu gave the assurance in Abuja on Thursday. She said ITPO would be a veritable platform through which both private stakeholders and the public with development partners and entrepreneurs could create collaborative links that would enhance competitiveness. Olumodimu said the office would also attract investment into the non-oil sector in Nigeria. “When we talk of poverty reduction, investment and job opportunity, it all lies in the SMEs platform. But as you know, whatever they produce cannot access the international market standard because of low quality,” she said. Olumodimu said the European Union gave Nigeria 12 million euros to support the enhancement of the national quality infrastructure, with a view to improving quality, safety, integrity and marketability of Nigerian goods and services. According to her, the country has improved in the quality of its products due to the establishment of some laboratories. “Some years back, we carried our products outside the country to test but now we do it in Nigeria because we have established some laboratories, so we only want to focus on upgrading our standards,” she said. Olumodimu Said the present administration had the political will to ensure standardisation of Nigerian products and that ITPO was only an intervention programme to help the government.
